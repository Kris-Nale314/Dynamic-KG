# Dynamic-KG: Technical Overview 🧠🔄💫

## Introduction 🌟

Dynamic-KG is an experimental framework for building evolving knowledge graphs that represent entities and their environments as digital twins. This document provides a technical deep dive into our approach, architecture, and key innovations. Our work sits at the intersection of knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), pushing the boundaries of what's possible in contextual decision support systems.

> **Note:** This framework is under active development and serves as both a practical tool and a research platform for exploring advanced AI techniques.

## Core Technical Innovations 🚀

### 1. Temporal Knowledge Graph Evolution 🕰️

Unlike static knowledge graphs, Dynamic-KG implements a temporal dimension that captures how entities and relationships evolve over time. This brings several technical challenges we're addressing:

#### 1.1 Versioned Graph Structures

We implement temporal knowledge modeling through:

- **Triple-level versioning**: Each subject-predicate-object triple carries temporal attributes (`valid_from`, `valid_to`) and confidence scoring
- **Temporal queries**: Our query language extends SPARQL/Cypher with temporal operators to retrieve state at specific time points
- **Difference detection**: Algorithms to efficiently compute and represent graph delta between temporal versions

```python
# Example of our temporal triple representation
{
    "subject": "CompanyA",
    "predicate": "has_annual_revenue",
    "object": "$10M",
    "valid_from": "2023-04-01",
    "valid_to": "2024-04-01",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "source": "financial_statement_2023"
}
```

#### 1.2 Temporal Reasoning Engine

Our reasoning engine handles time-aware inference through:

- **Temporal logic frameworks**: Implementing Allen's interval algebra for reasoning about time intervals
- **Decay functions**: Mathematical models that reduce confidence in facts as they age
- **Event-driven updates**: Trigger systems that propagate changes through the graph based on detected events

### 2. Multi-Modal Knowledge Integration 📊

Dynamic-KG ingests and fuses knowledge from multiple modalities and sources, addressing semantic heterogeneity challenges:

#### 2.1 Cross-Modal Entity Resolution

We've developed:

- **Hybrid entity matching**: Combining symbolic techniques with neural representations to identify the same entity across different sources
- **Contextualized identity resolution**: Using surrounding context to disambiguate entities with similar names/attributes
- **Confidence-weighted entity fusion**: Algorithms that merge entity information with appropriate uncertainty handling

#### 2.2 Semantic Alignment Pipeline

Our pipeline standardizes semantically equivalent but syntactically different concepts:

```
Raw Data → NLP Preprocessing → Entity Extraction → Relation Extraction → 
Ontology Mapping → Confidence Scoring → Knowledge Integration
```

With custom processors for different data types (financial statements, news articles, market reports).

### 3. LLM-Powered Knowledge Extraction 🧙‍♂️

We leverage LLMs not just for generation, but for sophisticated knowledge extraction:

#### 3.1 Structured Knowledge Extraction

Our approach includes:

- **Few-shot extraction patterns**: Template-based extraction prompts specialized by document type
- **Reasoning-enhanced extraction**: Multi-step reasoning to extract complex relationships that span multiple paragraphs
- **Self-verification cycles**: Having the LLM critically evaluate its own extraction for logical consistency

Example extraction prompt structure:
```
Context: {document_text}

Task: Extract all financial relationships between companies mentioned 
in the text in the following format:
{
  "entity1": str,
  "relationship_type": str,
  "entity2": str,
  "attributes": dict,
  "evidence": str
}

Step 1: Identify all company entities.
Step 2: For each pair of companies, determine if a financial relationship exists.
Step 3: Extract the details of each relationship with supporting evidence.
Step 4: Verify each extraction against the original text for accuracy.
...
```

#### 3.2 Implicit Knowledge Inference

Beyond explicit statements, we extract implied knowledge:

- **Counterfactual reasoning**: Identifying what is implied by the absence of information 
- **Chain-of-thought extraction**: Breaking down complex inferences into explicit intermediate steps
- **Domain-specific inference rules**: Encoding expert knowledge as inference patterns specific to domains

### 4. Evidence-Based Confidence Scoring 📏

A critical innovation is our nuanced approach to confidence scoring:

#### 4.1 Multi-Factor Confidence Model

Confidence scores combine:

- **Source reliability**: Weighted credibility of information source
- **Extraction confidence**: Model certainty in the extraction process
- **Temporal relevance**: How recent the information is
- **Corroboration level**: Whether multiple sources confirm the same fact
- **Logical consistency**: Compatibility with existing knowledge

Our scoring formula:
```
confidence = w₁·source_reliability + w₂·extraction_confidence + 
            w₃·temporal_relevance + w₄·corroboration + w₅·consistency
```

#### 4.2 Evidence Tracing System

Every fact in our knowledge graph maintains:

- **Evidence pointer**: Reference to source document/location
- **Extraction explanation**: Record of the reasoning process that produced the fact
- **Provenance chain**: Complete history of transformations and inferences
- **Alternative interpretations**: When multiple possible extractions exist

### 5. Dynamic Ontology Evolution ✨

Unlike fixed ontologies, our approach allows the knowledge structure itself to evolve:

#### 5.1 Adaptive Schema Learning

The system:

- **Detects emergent patterns**: Identifies recurring relationship types not in the initial schema
- **Proposes schema extensions**: Suggests new classes, relationships, and attributes
- **Validates through instances**: Tests proposed schema elements against extracted instances
- **Maintains backward compatibility**: Ensures queries against older schema versions still work

#### 5.2 Hierarchical Ontology Architecture

We implement a layered ontology:

- **Core layer**: Stable, foundational concepts
- **Domain layer**: Industry/vertical specific extensions
- **Application layer**: Use-case specific customizations
- **Instance layer**: Emergent patterns specific to the current dataset

## Next Best Action Technical System 🎯

Our Next Best Action engine builds on the knowledge graph to provide context-aware recommendations:

### 1. Information Value Calculation

We model the expected value of information using:

- **Bayesian Decision Networks**: Modeling decisions, information states, and outcomes
- **Value of Information (VoI)**: Calculating expected entropy reduction from potential questions
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimizing multi-step information gathering sequences

The core equation:
```
VOI(q) = E[max_a u(a|q)] - max_a E[u(a)]
```
Where `q` is a possible question, `a` is an action, and `u` is utility.

### 2. Counterfactual Recommendation Generation

Our system generates recommendations by:

- **Counterfactual simulation**: "What if we knew X about this entity?"
- **Confidence threshold analysis**: "What information would raise decision confidence above threshold T?"
- **Knowledge gap detection**: "What critical relationships are missing or uncertain?"
- **Path discovery**: "What sequence of questions minimizes decision uncertainty?"

### 3. Explanation Generation

Each recommendation comes with:

- **Decision path explanation**: The reasoning chain from evidence to recommendation
- **Uncertainty highlighting**: Visual indication of confidence in each step
- **Alternative perspectives**: What different conclusions might be drawn from the same evidence
- **Contextual relevance**: Why this recommendation matters in the current context

- Automatic ontology induction
- Schema mapping and migration
- Query translation across evolving schemas

## Conclusion 🌈

Dynamic-KG represents a novel approach to building knowledge systems that evolve and adapt over time, maintaining their connection to evidence while incorporating new information. While we've chosen financial risk assessment as our initial application domain, the technical innovations are applicable across many domains where complex, contextual decision-making is required.

As an experimental framework, we invite collaboration and extension of these ideas, with the goal of advancing the state of the art in contextual AI systems that truly understand the environments they operate in.
